# Stock-Market-Indexes-with-Scrapy
SMIwithScrapy is a crawler for Yahoo Finance based on the Scrapy framework.The objective of this Scrapy project is to help me understand and the basic framework of Scrapy.

# Notes
When an item is scraped by a spider, it is sent to the pipeline. Since the data is converted to csv file, if there's a comma in the value, it will be removed. The index name is modifed as well for better interpretation
